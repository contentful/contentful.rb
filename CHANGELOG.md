**ATTENTION**: Breaking Changes introduces in order to simplify code and improve the ability to add new features.

### Changed

* The removal of the Client and Request objects from the Resource objects, means that for example: Link#resolve and Array#next_page now require the client as a parameter.
* Client#entry now uses /entries?sys.id=ENTRY_ID instead of /entries/ENTRY_ID to properly resolve includes.

* Refactor ResourceBuilder
* Update all specs to RSpec 3
* Removed DynamicEntry and Resource
* Moved ContentTypeCache outside of the client into it's own class
* Added new base BaseResource and FieldsResource classes to handle common resource attributes and fields related attributes respectively
* Coercions are now part of ContentType, each Field knows which coercion should be applied depending on Field#type
* Resource #inspect now provides a clearer and better output, without all the noise that was previously there
* CustomResource was removed, now subclasses of Entry should be used instead.
* `max_include_resolution_depth` option added to the client, defaults to 20.

## 1.0.0

**ATTENTION**: Breaking changes on how JSON Fields are parsed. All keys are now symbolized, including
nested hashes. Parsing errors have been fixed, particularly for `array`, `null` and `boolean` present on the first
level of the JSON field. Also, on release 0.11.0, it was fixed that JSON Fields were being treated as locales.
This change increases consistency for the SDK, treating everything the same way. We strive for consistency and
quality in our tools.

The following `diff` shows previous and current state. This is the contents of the JSON Field we test this feature against.

```diff
- {:null=>"",
-  :text=>"some text",
-  :array=>"[1, 2, 3]",
-  :number=>123,
-  :object=>
-   {"null"=>nil,
-    "text"=>"bar",
-    "array"=>[1, 2, 3],
-    "number"=>123,
-    "object"=>{"foo"=>"bar"},
-    "boolean"=>false},
-  :boolean=>"true"}
+ {:null=>nil,
+  :text=>"some text",
+  :array=>[1, 2, 3],
+  :number=>123,
+  :object=>
+   {:null=>nil,
+   :text=>"bar",
+   :array=>[1, 2, 3],
+   :number=>123,
+   :object=>{:foo=>"bar"},
+   :boolean=>false},
+  :boolean=>true}
```
