# Change Log

## Unreleased
### Fixed
* Fix Link resolution on localized content

### Changed
* Removed dependency lock specific for Ruby < 2.0 support

## 1.0.0

**ATTENTION**: Breaking changes on how JSON Fields are parsed. All keys are now symbolized, including
nested hashes. Parsing errors have been fixed, particularly for `array`, `null` and `boolean` present on the first
level of the JSON field. Also, on release 0.11.0, it was fixed that JSON Fields were being treated as locales.
This change increases consistency for the SDK, treating everything the same way. We strive for consistency and
quality in our tools.

The following `diff` shows previous and current state. This is the contents of the JSON Field we test this feature against.

```diff
- {:null=>"",
-  :text=>"some text",
-  :array=>"[1, 2, 3]",
-  :number=>123,
-  :object=>
-   {"null"=>nil,
-    "text"=>"bar",
-    "array"=>[1, 2, 3],
-    "number"=>123,
-    "object"=>{"foo"=>"bar"},
-    "boolean"=>false},
-  :boolean=>"true"}
+ {:null=>nil,
+  :text=>"some text",
+  :array=>[1, 2, 3],
+  :number=>123,
+  :object=>
+   {:null=>nil,
+   :text=>"bar",
+   :array=>[1, 2, 3],
+   :number=>123,
+   :object=>{:foo=>"bar"},
+   :boolean=>false},
+  :boolean=>true}
```
