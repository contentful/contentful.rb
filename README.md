**What is Contentful?**

[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) provides content infrastructure for digital teams to power websites, apps, and devices. Unlike a CMS, Contentful was built to integrate with the modern software stack. It offers a central hub for structured content, powerful management and delivery APIs, and a customizable web app that enable developers and content creators to ship their products faster.

## Core Features

- Content retrieval through [Content Delivery API](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/) and [Content Preview API](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-preview-api/).
- [Synchronization](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/concepts/sync/)
- [Localization support](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/concepts/locales/)
- [Link resolution](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/concepts/links/)
- Built in rate limiting recovery procedures
- Supports [Environments](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/concepts/multiple-environments/) (**since v2.6.0 - 16. April 2018**)

## Getting started

In order to get started with the Contentful Ruby SDK you'll need not only to install it, but also to get credentials which will allow you to have access to your content in Contentful.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Your first request](#your-first-request)
- [Using this SDK with the Preview API](#using-this-sdk-with-the-preview-api)
- [Authentication](#authentication)
- [Documentation & References](#documentation--references)

### Installation

Add to your Gemfile and bundle:

```bash
gem 'contentful'
```

Or install it directly from your console:

```bash
gem i contentful
```

### Your first request

The following code snippet is the most basic one you can use to get some content from Contentful with this SDK:

```ruby
require 'contentful'

client = Contentful::Client.new(
  space: 'cfexampleapi',  # This is the space ID. A space is like a project folder in Contentful terms
  access_token: 'b4c0n73n7fu1'  # This is the access token for this space. Normally you get both ID and the token in the Contentful web app
)

# This API call will request an entry with the specified ID from the space defined at the top, using a space-specific access token.
entry = client.entry('nyancat')
```

### Using this SDK with the Preview API

This SDK can also be used with the Preview API. In order to do so, you need to use the Preview API Access token, available on the same page where you get the Delivery API token, and specify the host of the preview API, such as:

```ruby
require 'contentful'

client = Contentful::Client.new(
  space: 'cfexampleapi',
  access_token: 'b4c0n73n7fu1',
  api_url: 'preview.contentful.com'
)
```

You can query for entries, assets, etc. very similar as described in the
[Delivery API Documentation](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/). Please note, that **all methods of the Ruby client library are snake_cased, instead of JavaScript's camelCase**:

### Authentication

To get your own content from Contentful, an app should authenticate with an OAuth bearer token.

You can create API keys using the [Contentful web interface](https://app.contentful.com). Go to the app, open the space that you want to access (top left corner lists all the spaces), and navigate to the APIs area. Open the API Keys section and create your first token. Done.

Don't forget to also get your Space ID.

For more information, check the [Contentful REST API reference on Authentication](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/authentication/).

To help you get the most out of this SDK, we've prepared all available client configuration options, reference documentation, tutorials and other examples that will help you learn and understand how to use this library.

### Configuration

The client constructor supports several options you may set to achieve the expected behavior:

```ruby
client = Contentful::Client.new(
  # ... your options here ...
)
```

        This include resolution strategy is in place in order to avoid having infinite circular recursion on resources with circular dependencies.
        <strong>Note</strong>: If you're using something like <code>Rails::cache</code> it's advisable to considerably lower this value
        (around 5 has proven to be a good compromise - but keep it higher or equal than your maximum API-level include parameter if you need the entire tree resolution).
        Note that when <code>reuse_entries</code> is enabled, the max include resolution depth only affects
        deep chains of unique objects (ie, not simple circular references).

        This can be a good alternative to <code>max_include_resolution_depth</code> if your content model contains (or can contain) circular references.
        <strong>Caching may break if this option is enabled, as it may generate stack errors.</strong>

### Reference documentation

#### Basic queries

```ruby
content_types = client.content_types
cat_content_type = client.content_type 'cat'
nyancat = client.entry 'nyancat'
entries = client.entries
assets = client.assets
nyancat_asset = client.asset 'nyancat'
```

#### Filtering options

You can pass the usual filter options to the query:

```ruby
client.entries(content_type: 'cat') # query for a content-type by its ID (not name)
client.entries('sys.id[ne]' => 'nyancat') # query for all entries except 'nyancat'
client.entries(include: 1) # include one level of linked resources
client.entries(content_type: 'cat', include: 1) # you can also combine multiple parameters
```

To read more about filtering options you can check our [search parameters documentation](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/#/reference/search-parameters).

The results are returned as `Contentful::BaseResource` objects. Multiple results will be returned as `Contentful::Array`.
The properties of a resource can be accessed through Ruby methods.

#### Accessing fields and sys properties

```ruby
content_type = client.content_type 'cat'
content_type.description # "Meow."
```

System Properties behave the same and can be accessed via the `#sys` method.

```ruby
content_type.id # => 'cat'
entry.type # => 'Entry'
asset.sys # { id: '...', type: '...' }
```

Entry fields also have direct accessors and will be coerced to the type defined in it's content type.
However, if using `dynamic_entries: :manual`, coercion will not be done.

```ruby
entry = client.entry 'nyancat'
entry.fields[:color] # 'rainbow'
entry.color # 'rainbow'
entry.birthday # #<DateTime: 2011-04-04T22:00:00+00:00 ((2455656j,79200s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>
```

#### Dynamic entries

However, you can (and should) set `:dynamic_entries` to `:auto` in your client configuration.
When using this option, the client will cache all available content types and use them to hydrate entries when fields are missing in the response and coerce fields to their proper types.

```ruby
client = Contentful::Client.new(
  access_token: 'b4c0n73n7fu1',
  space: 'cfexampleapi',
  dynamic_entries: :auto
)

entry = client.entry 'nyancat' # => #<Contentful::Entry[cat]: ...>
entry.color # => 'rainbow'
entry.birthday # #<DateTime: 2011-04-04T22:00:00+00:00 ((2455656j,79200s,0n),+0s,2299161j)>
```

Dynamic entries will have getter classes for the fields and do type conversions properly.

The `:auto` mode will fetch all content types on initialization. If you want to do it by hand later, you will need to set the option to `:manual` and call `client.update_dynamic_entry_cache!` to initialize the cache.

#### Using different locales

Entries can have multiple locales, by default, the client only fetches the entry with only its default locale.
If you want to fetch a different locale you can do the following:

```ruby
entries = client.entries(locale: 'de-DE')
```

Then all the fields will be fetched for the requested locale.

Contentful Delivery API also allows to fetch all locales, you can do so by doing:

```ruby
entries = client.entries(content_type: 'cat', locale: '*')

# assuming the entry has a field called name
my_spanish_name = entries.first.fields('es-AR')[:name]
```

When requesting multiple locales, the object accessor shortcuts only work for the default locale.

#### Arrays

Contentful::Array has an `#each` method that delegates to its items. It also includes Ruby's Enumerable module, providing methods like `#min` or `#first`. See the Ruby core documentation for further details.

Arrays also have a `#next_page` URL, which will rerun the request with a increased skip parameter, as described in [the documentation](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/#/reference/search-parameters/skip).


#### Links

You can easily request a resource that is represented by a link by calling `#resolve`:

```ruby
happycat = client.entry 'happycat'
happycat.image
# => #<Contentful::Link: @sys={:type=>"Link", :linkType=>"Asset", :id=>"happycat"}>
happycat.image.resolve(client) # => #<Contentful::Asset: @fields={ ...
```

### Assets

There is a helpful method to add image resize options for an asset image:

```ruby
client.asset('happycat').url
# => "//images.contentful.com/cfexampleapi/3MZPnjZTIskAIIkuuosCss/
#     382a48dfa2cb16c47aa2c72f7b23bf09/happycatw.jpg"

client.asset('happycat').url(width: 300, height: 200, format: 'jpg', quality: 100)
# => "//images.contentful.com/cfexampleapi/3MZPnjZTIskAIIkuuosCss/
#     382a48dfa2cb16c47aa2c72f7b23bf09/happycatw.jpg?w=300&h=200&fm=jpg&q=100"
```

#### Resource options

Resources, that have been requested directly (i.e. no child resources), can be fetched from the server again by calling `#reload`:

```ruby
entries = client.entries
entries.reload # Fetches the array of entries again
```

#### Field type `Object`

While for known field types, the field data is accessible using methods or the `#fields` hash with symbol keys, it behaves differently for nested data of the type "Object".
The client will treat them as arbitrary hashes and will not parse the data inside.


### Advanced concepts

#### Proxy example

```ruby
client = Contentful::Client.new(
  access_token: 'b4c0n73n7fu1',
  space: 'cfexampleapi',
  proxy_host: '127.0.0.1',
  proxy_port: 8080,
  proxy_username: 'username',
  proxy_password: 'secret_password',
)
```

#### Custom resource classes

You can define your own classes that will be returned instead of the predefined ones. Consider, you want to build a better Asset class. One way to do this is:

```ruby
class MyBetterAsset < Contentful::Asset
  def https_image_url
    image_url.sub %r<\A//>, 'https://'
  end
end
```

You can register your custom class on client initialization:

```ruby
client = Contentful::Client.new(
  space: 'cfexampleapi',
  access_token: 'b4c0n73n7fu1',
  resource_mapping: {
    'Asset' => MyBetterAsset
  }
)
```

More information on `:resource_mapping` can be found in [examples/resource_mapping.rb](./examples/resource_mapping.rb)
and more on custom classes in [examples/custom_classes.rb](./examples/custom_classes.rb).

You can also register custom entry classes to be used based on the entry's content_type using the `:entry_mapping` configuration:

```ruby
class Cat < Contentful::Entry
  # define methods based on :fields, etc
end

client = Contentful::Client.new(
  space: 'cfexampleapi',
  access_token: 'b4c0n73n7fu1',
  entry_mapping: {
    'cat' => Cat
  }
)

client.entry('nyancat') # is instance of Cat
```

#### Synchronization

The client also includes a wrapper for the synchronization endpoint.
You can initialize it with the options described in the
[Delivery API Documentation](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/#/reference/synchronization)
or an URL you received from a previous sync:

```ruby
client = Contentful::Client.new(
  access_token: 'b4c0n73n7fu1',
  space: 'cfexampleapi',
  default_locale: 'en-US'
)

sync = client.sync(initial: true, type: 'Deletion') # Only returns deleted entries and assets
sync = client.sync("https://cdn.contentful.com/spaces/cfexampleapi/sync?sync_token=w5ZGw6JFwqZmVcKsE8Kow4gr...sGPg") # Continues a sync
```

You can access the results either wrapped in `Contentful::SyncPage` objects:

```ruby
sync.each_page do |page|
  # Find resources at: page.items
end

# More explicit version:
page = sync.first_page
until sync.completed?
  page = sync.next_page
end
```

Or directly iterative over all resources:

```ruby
sync.each_item do |resource|
  # ...
end
```

When a sync is completed, the next sync url can be read from the Sync or SyncPage object:

```ruby
sync.next_sync_url
```

**Please note** that synchronization entries come in all locales, so make sure, you supply a :default_locale property to the client configuration, when using the sync feature. This locale will be returned by default, when you call `Entry#fields`. The other localized data will also be saved and can be accessed by calling the fields method with a locale parameter:

```ruby
first_entry = client.sync(initial: true, type: 'Entry').first_page.items.first
first_entry.fields('de-DE') # Returns German localizations
```

### Migrating to 2.x

If you're a `0.x` or a `1.x` user of this gem, and are planning to migrate to the current `2.x` branch.
There are a few breaking changes you have to take into account:

* `Contentful::Link#resolve` and `Contentful::Array#next_page` now require a `Contentful::Client` instance as a parameter.
* `Contentful::CustomResource` does no longer exist, custom entry classes can now inherit from `Contentful::Entry` and have proper marshalling working.
* `Contentful::Resource` does no longer exist, all resource classes now inherit from `Contentful::BaseResource`. `Contentful::Entry` and `Contentful::Asset` inherit from `Contentful::FieldsResource` which is a subclass of `Contentful::BaseResource`.
* `Contentful::DynamicEntry` does no longer exist, if code checked against that base class, it should now check against `Contentful::Entry` instead.
* `Contentful::Client#dynamic_entry_cache` _(private)_ has been extracted to it's own class, and can be now manually cleared by using `Contentful::ContentTypeCache::clear`.
* `Contentful::BaseResource#sys` and `Contentful::FieldsResource#fields` internal representation for keys are now snake cased to match the instance accessors. E.g. `entry.fields[:myField]` previously had the accessor `entry.my_field`, now it is `entry.fields[:my_field]`. The value in both cases would correspond to the same field, only change is to unify the style. If code accessed the values through the `#sys` or `#fields` methods, keys now need to be snake cased.
* Circular references are handled as individual objects to simplify marshalling and reduce stack errors, this introduces a performance hit on extremely interconnected content. Therefore, to limit the impact of circular references, an additional configuration flag `max_include_resolution_depth` has been added. It is set to 20 by default (which corresponds to the maximum include level value * 2). This allows for non-circular but highly connected content to resolve properly. In very interconnected content, it also allows to reduce this number to improve performance. For a more in depth look into this you can read [this issue](https://github.com/contentful/contentful.rb/issues/124#issuecomment-287002469).
* `#inspect` now offers a clearer and better output for all resources. If your code had assertions based on the string representation of the resources, update to the new format `<Contentful::#{RESOURCE_CLASS}#{additional_info} id="#{RESOURCE_ID}">`.
